All the details are reported in the report.

To prove the different files keep in mind the following:

 - mmn_queue is the file containing the behavior of the m/m/1.

 - mmn_graphics throw out the graphics for the view of the supermarket model.

 - storage contains the part relevant the client server and the peer to peer configuration: to switch on one or the other we put a simple flag IF_PEER to set True if wants to use the peer to peer configuration, then uncomment the correct configuration that you want to take in consideration. Otherwise will be done with the client server configuration. Also if the SELFISH_node is set to True we are enabling the mode of nodes to be selfish as reported in the repo. Adjust the right comment to see different representation and result. (also this need only to be lunched without argument to use like we do in our report)
